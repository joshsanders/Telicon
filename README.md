<!-- ![Telicon Logo ](https://cdn.rawgit.com/joshsanders/telicon/49201d3c/docs/logo.svg) -->

A telecom-centric, SVG-based icon font designed for Monster UI&mdash;an interface layer for the Unified Communications platform [KAZOO](https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo).

## Getting Started
Lorem Ipsum...

## Project Progress
Keep track of Telicon's progress through the project's [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/joshsanders/telicon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Icon Workflow
Icons will be updated/added as needed. All new and updated icons should be referenced in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/joshsanders/telicon/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file as a `minor` version update.

* Source svg files for each icon can be found within the [`src/icons/svg/...`](https://github.com/joshsanders/telicon/tree/master/src/icons/svg) directory.

The following tools are currently used to design and produce icons and assets:

* Adobe Illustrator (any vector editor will do) to create the source icons
* Spritebot for svg optimization and sprite creation (still requires some manual cleanup...looking into more customizable options via SVGO and svgstore gulp workflows)

## Versioning
Telicon will be maintained under the [Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org) as much as possible. Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* Changes or updates(like new icons) without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes, changes to individual icons, and misc changes bumps the patch

## Copyright and License
